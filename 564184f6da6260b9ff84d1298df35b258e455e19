      "message": "This for loop is all that\u0027s killing it. Seems that because the sdcard slot is considered a complete different disk by Vold, when it runs this block of code again, the mPartMinors array gets reset completely.\n\nThis doesn\u0027t seem to affect maxwen since on his device, the external card is considered as just another partition on the same disk.",

      "message": "Actually, looking at it a bit further, it seems that we have a few \"partitions\" that identify themselves as disks, causing this block of code to be run unnecessarily for a few more times, causing the mPartMinor array to be reset.\n\nAlso, looks like when external storage is mounted, it runs on a separate thread, and starts with mPartMinors being a clean slate, and separate from internal storage.\n\nAll these things considered, we can therefore probably remove this for loop, since it\u0027s honestly not doing any good.",
